### Hi there 👋

My name is João Vitor Pereira from Brazil (🇧🇷). I am passionate about mobile and front-end development, always looking to learn the new technologies that appear on the market.

In my free time I like to play soccer(⚽️)  and watch the best team in the world, Palmeiras , to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to drink with my friends(🍺) 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Node, Js
